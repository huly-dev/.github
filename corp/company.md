---

## About Us

## Testimonials

"Real engineering, no management overhead" -- Andrey Platov

## Culture

No rituals. We hold two brief sync sessions daily, one at 9:30 AM CET and another at 4:30 PM CET â€” each around 15 minutes. You're required to attend the one that best fits your timezone. We define ourselves as 'post-Agile.' Our focus is on 'shipping work that matters' and our processes are more closely aligned with Basecamp's Shape Up approach (https://basecamp.com/shapeup) than with Scrum.

## Jobs

We're hiring exceptional engineers. Always.

## Remote Benefits

We bring the team together annually for a company offsite to connect, collaborate, and unwind. Our last gathering was in October 2023 in the city of Istanbul, Turkey.

## Perks

- Work from anywhere: We're remote from day one
- Trust professionals: We do not micromanage and trust our engineers to make the best choices when it comes to the tools and technologies. You know what will serve the project best, be it Rust, Go, or any other language, library or tool.

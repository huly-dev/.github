## Desciption

[Huly](https://huly.io) is our flagship project and process management tool. You can explore the product at https://huly.io. Crafted as an all-in-one solution, Huly helps teams manage their work and serves as an alternative to applications like Jira, Linear, Asana, Slack, Notion, Motion, and Roam.

As a QA Engineer at Hardcore Engineering, your role involves automating UI tests using Playwright within our existing infrastructure. Huly is Open Source and built on top of our Open Source Platform, which means you can review the product's source code and existing tests here: https://github.com/hcengineering/platform.

Your goal will be to significantly expand our test suite. Remember, when it comes to testing, there is no such thing as too many tests.

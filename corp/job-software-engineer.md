## Desciption

[Huly](https://huly.io) is our flagship project and process management tool. You can explore the product at https://huly.io. Crafted as an all-in-one solution, Huly helps teams manage their work and serves as an alternative to applications like Jira, Linear, Asana, Slack, Notion, Motion, and Roam.

As a Software Engineer at Hardcore Engineering, your role will involve further developing Huly and the Huly Platform. Huly is open-source, allowing you to review the product's source code and determine if it aligns with your understanding of a codebase you would like to work with: https://github.com/hcengineering/platform.

Huly is built with TypeScript among other technologies, but we're more focused on your problem-solving abilities than your familiarity with our current tech stack. No experience with the Huly stack? No problem. We're in search of individuals who are quick learners and capable of adapting to new challenges.
